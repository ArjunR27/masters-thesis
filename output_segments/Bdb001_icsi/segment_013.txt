-Well, I think the other thing we might want to look at is alternatives to P-file. I mean, th the reason I like P-file is I'm already familiar with it, we have expertise here,
-and so if we pick something else, there's the learning-curve problem. But, I mean, it is just something we developed at ICSI.
-And so
-Is there an is there an IP-API?
-Yeah. There's an API for it. And, uh,
-OK.
-There used to be a problem that they get too large,
-a bunch of libraries, P-file utilities.
-and so basically the uh the filesystem
-Well, that's gonna be a problem no matter what. You have the two-gigabyte limit on the filesystem size.
-wouldn't
-And we definitely hit that with Broadcast News.
-Maybe you could extend the API to, uh, support, uh, like splitting up,
-you know, conceptually one file into smaller files on disk so that you can essentially,
-Yep.
-you know, have arbitrarily long f
-Most of the tools can handle that. So that
-Yeah.
-we didn't do it at the API-level. We did it at the t tool-level. That that most many of them can s you can specify several P-files and they'll just be done sequentially.
-OK.
-So.
-So, I guess, yeah, if if you and Don can if you can show him the P-file stuff and see. So this would be like for the F-zero
-Sure.
-I mean, if you do "man P-file" or "apropos P-file", you'll see a lot.
-True.
-I've used the P-file, I think. I've looked at it at least, briefly, I think when we were doing
-What does the P stand for anyway?
-s something.
-I have no idea.
-Oh, in there.
-I didn't de I didn't develop it. You know, it was I think it was Dave Johnson.
-So it's all part of the Quicknet library. It has all the utilities for it.
-No, P-files were around way before Quicknet.
-Oh, were they?
-P-files were were around when w with, um, RAP.
-Mm-hmm.
-It's like the history of ICSI. Like
-Right?
-You worked with P-files. I worked with P-files.
-Mm-hmm.
-No.
-Yeah?
-I don't remember what the "P" is, though.
-Is it related to P-make?
-No.
-But there are ni they're
-The Quicknet library has a bunch of things in it to handle P-files, so it works pretty well.
-Yeah.
