-Do you Are you familiar with it? I haven't seen this particular format, but
-So.
-I mean, I've I've used them. I don't know what their structure is. I've forgot what the str
-OK.
-But, wait a minute, P-file for each frame is storing a vector of cepstral or PLP values, right?
-It's whatever you want, actually. So that what's nice about the P-file It i
-Right.
-Built into it is the concept of frames, utterances, sentences, that sort of thing, that structure.
-And then also attached to it is an arbitrary vector of values.
-Oh.
-And it can take different types. So it th they don't all have to be floats. You know, you can have integers and you can have doubles, and all that sort of stuff.
-So that that sounds that sounds about what I w
-Um.
-Right? And it has a header it has a header format that describes it to some extent. So,
-the only problem with it is it's actually storing the utterance numbers and the frame numbers in the file,
-even though they're always sequential. And so it does waste a lot of space.
-Hmm.
-But it's still a lot tighter than than ASCII. And we have a lot of tools already to deal with it.
-You do? OK. Is there some documentation on this somewhere? OK, great. So,
-Yeah, there's a ton of it. Man-pages and, uh, source code, and
-I mean, that sounds good. I I was just looking for something I'm not a database person, but something sort of standard enough that,
-me.
-you know, if we start using this we can give it out, other people can work on it, or Is it?
-Yeah, it's not standard. I mean, it's something that we developed at ICSI.
-But, uh
-But it's been used here and people've
-But it's been used here and and, you know, we have a well-configured system that you can distribute for free, and
