-See, I think the kinds of questions, at least in the next to the end of this year, are
-there may be a lot of different ones, but they'll all have a similar nature. They'll be
-looking at either a word-level prosodic,
-uh, an a value, like a continuous value, like the slope of something. But
-Mm-hmm.
-you know, we'll do something where we
-some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort o uh, either at the word-level or at the
-segment-level, or or something like that. They're not gonna be at the phone-level and they're no not gonna be at the frame-level when we get done with
-Right.
-sort of giving them simpler shapes and things.
-And so the main thing is just being able
-Well, I guess, the two goals. Um, one that Chuck mentioned is
-starting out with something that we don't have to start over, that we don't have to throw away if other people want to extend it for other kinds of questions,
-Right.
-and being able to at least get enough, uh, information out on
-where we condition the location of features on information that's in the kind of file that you put up there.
-And that would that would do it, I mean, for me.
-Yeah. I think that there are quick and dirty solutions, and then there are long-term, big-infrastructure solutions. And so
-we want to try to pick something that lets us do a little bit of both.
-In the between, right. And especially that the representation doesn't have to be thrown away, even if your tools change.
-Um
-Right.
-And so it seems to me that I mean, I have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want,
-but if we use the ATLAS external file representation,
-um,
-it seems like it's rich enough that you could do quick tools just as I said in Perl,
-Yeah.
-and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve, we can use the whole ATLAS inter infrastructure,
-I mean, that sounds good to me. I I don't
-which has all that built in.
-So if if you would l look at that and let us know what you think. I mean,
-Sure.
