-I I guess my question is more,
-uh, what d what do you do with, say, a forced alignment? I mean you've got all these phone labels, and what do you do if you
-How-how
-just conceptually, if you get, um, transcriptions where the words are staying
-but the time boundaries are changing, cuz you've got a new recognition output, or s sort of what's the, um,
-sequence of going from the
-waveforms that stay the same, the transcripts that may or may not change, and then the
-utterance which where the time boundaries that may or may not change?
-Oh, that's
-That's actually very nicely handled here because you could you could all you'd have to change is the,
-Um.
-um, time-stamps in the time-line without without, uh, changing the I Ds.
-And you'd be able to propagate all of the
-Right. That's, the who that's why you do that extra level of indirection.
-the information?
-So that you can just change the time-line.
-Except the time-line is gonna be huge. If you say suppose you have a phone-level alignment. You'd have you'd have
-Yes.
-Yeah, yeah, especially at the phone-level. The we we have phone-level backtraces.
-Yeah, this I don't think I would do this for phone-level.
-Um
-I think for phone-level you want to use some sort of binary representation because it'll be too dense otherwise.
-OK. So, if you were doing that and you had this sort of companion, uh, thing that gets called up for phone-level, uh, what would that look like? How would you?
-I would use just an existing
-Why-
-Mmm. But but why not use it for phone-level? It's just a matter of it's just a matter of it being bigger. But if you have
-H h
-an existing way of doing it.
-you know, barring memory limitations, or uh I w I mean this is still the m
-It's parsing limitations. I don't want to have this text file that you have to read in the whole thing to do something very simple for.
-Oh, no. You would use it only for purposes where you actually want the phone-level information, I'd imagine.
-So you could have some file that configures how much information you want in your in your XML or something.
-Right. I mean, you'd y I I am imagining you'd have multiple versions of this depending on the information that you want.
-You
-Um, cuz th it does get very bush with
-Right.
-Um, I'm just what I'm wondering is whether I think for word-level, this would be OK.
-Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.
-For word-level, it's alright.
-Mm-hmm.
-For lower than word-level, you're talking about so much data that I just I don't know. I don't know if that
-I mean, we actually have So, one thing that Don is doing, is we're we're running
-Lattices are big, too.
-For every frame, you get a pitch value, and not only one pitch value but different kinds of pitch values depending on
-Yeah, I mean, for something like that I would use P-file or or any frame-level stuff I would use P-file.
-Meaning?
-Uh, that's a well, or something like it. It's ICS uh, ICSI has a format for frame-level representation of features.
-OK. That you could call that you would tie into this representation with like an ID.
-Um.
-Right.
-Right. Or or there's a there's a particular way in XML to refer to external resources.
-And
-OK.
-So you would say "refer to this external file".
-Um, so that external file wouldn't be in
-So that might that might work.
-But what what's the advantage of doing that versus just putting it into this format?
-More compact, which I think is is better. I mean, if you did it at this
-Uh-huh.
-I mean these are long meetings and with for every frame, um
-You don't want to do it with that Anything at frame-level you had better encode binary or it's gonna be really painful.
-Or you just compre I mean, I like text formats. Um, b you can always, uh, G-zip them,
-and, um, you know, c decompress them on the fly if y if space is really a concern.
-Yeah, I was thi
-I was thinking the advantage is that we can share this with other people.
-Well, but if you're talking about one per frame,
-you're talking about gigabyte-size files. You're gonna actually run out of space in your filesystem for one file.
-These are big files. These are really I mean
-Right? Because you have a two-gigabyte limit on most O Ss.
-Right, OK. I would say OK, so frame-level is probably not a good idea. But for phone-level stuff it's perfectly
-And th it's
-Like phones, or syllables, or anything like that.
-Phones are every five frames though, so.
-Or something like that.
-But but but most of the frames are actually not speech.
-So, you know, people don't
-Yeah, but we actually
-v Look at it, words times the average The average number of phones in an English word is, I don't know, five maybe?
-So, look at it, t number of words times five. That's not that not
-Oh, so you mean pause phones take up a lot of the long pause phones.
-Yep.
-Exactly. Yeah.
-Yeah. OK. That's true. But you do have to keep them in there. Y yeah. OK.
-So I think it it's debatable whether you want to do phone-level in the same thing. But I think, a anything at frame-level, even P-file,
-OK.
-So
-is too verbose. I would use something tighter than P-files.
