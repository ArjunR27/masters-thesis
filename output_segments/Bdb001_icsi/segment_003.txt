-Yeah, I'm I'm familiar with that. I mean, we I sort of already have developed an XML format
-um, which
-Can I see it?
-for this sort of stuff. And so the only question
-is it the sort of thing that you want to use or not?
-Have you looked at that? I mean, I had a web page up.
-Right. So,
-I actually mostly need to be able to link up, or
-So
-You mean, this
-I it's it's a question both of what the representation is and
-I guess I am gonna be standing up and drawing on the board.
-OK, yeah. So you should, definitely.
-Um, so so it definitely had that as a concept. So tha it has a single time-line,
-Mm-hmm.
-and then you can have lots of different sections, each of which have I Ds attached to it, and then you can refer from other sections to those I Ds,
-if you want to.
-So that, um
-so that you start with with a time-line tag.
-"Time-line".
-And then you have a bunch of times.
-I don't e I don't remember exactly what my notation was, but it
-Oh, I remember seeing an example of this. Yeah.
-Right, right.
-Yeah, "T equals one point
-three two", uh
-And then I I also had optional things like accuracy,
-and then "ID equals T one, uh, one seven". And then,
-I also wanted to to be i to be able to not specify specifically what the time was and just have a stamp.
-Right.
-Yeah, so these are arbitrary, assigned by a program, not not by a user. So you have a whole bunch of those.
-And then somewhere la further down you might have something like an utterance tag
-which has "start
-equals T-seventeen, end equals T-eighteen".
-So what that's saying is, we know it starts at this particular time. We don't know when it ends.
-OK.
-Right? But it ends at this T-eighteen, which may be somewhere else. We say there's another utterance.
-We don't know what the t time actually is but we know that it's the same time as this end time.
-Mmm.
-You know, thirty-eight, whatever you want.
-So you're essentially defining a lattice.
-OK.
-Yes, exactly.
-Yeah.
-And then, uh and then these also have I Ds.
-Right? So you could you could have some sort of other other tag later in the file that would be something like, um,
-oh, I don't know, uh,
-"noise-type equals
-door-slam". You know?
-And then, uh,
-you could either say "time equals a particular time-mark" or you could do other sorts of references.
-So or or you might have a prosody
-"Prosody" right? D? T?
-It's an O instead of an I, but the D is good.
-You like the D? That's a good D.
-Yeah.
-Um,
-you know, so you could have some sort of type here,
-and then you could have, um
-the utterance that it's referring to could be U-seventeen or something like that.
