-I mean, it must be the equivalent of whatever you guys used to store feat your computed features in, right?
-OK.
-Yeah, th we have
-Actually, we we use a generalization of the the Sphere format.
-Mmm.
-Um, but
-Yeah, so there is something like that but it's, um, probably not as sophist
-And I think there's
-Well, what does H T K do for features? Or does it even have a concept of features?
-They ha it has its own
-I mean, Entropic has their own feature format that's called, like, S-SD or some so SF or something like that.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-I'm just wondering, would it be worth while to use that instead?
-Hmm?
-Yeah. Th-this is exactly the kind of decision It's just whatever
-But, I mean, people don't typically share this kind of stuff, right? I mean
-Right.
-They generate their own.
-Actually, I
-Yeah.
-I just you know, we we've done this stuff on prosodics and
-three or four places have asked for those prosodic files, and we just have an ASCII,
-uh, output of frame-by-frame. Which is fine,
-Ah, right.
-but it gets unwieldy to go in and and query these files with really huge files.
-Right.
-I mean, we could do it. I was just thinking if there's something that where all the frame values are Hmm?
-And a and again, if you have a
-if you have a two-hour-long meeting, that's gonna
-They're they're fair they're quite large. And these are for ten-minute Switchboard conversations, and
-Yeah, I mean, they'd be emo enormous.
-Right.
-So it's doable, it's just that you can only store a feature vector at frame-by-frame and it doesn't have any kind of,
-um
-Is is the sharing part of this a pretty important consideration or does that just sort of, uh a nice thing to have?
-I I don't know enough about what we're gonna do with the data. But I thought it would be good to get something that
-we can that other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of
-encoding. And just, I mean we have to use some we have to make some decision about what to do. And especially for the prosody work, what
-Yeah.
-what it ends up being is you get
-features from the signal, and of course those change every time your alignments change. So you re-run a recognizer, you want to recompute
-your features, um, and then keep the database up to date. Or you change a word, or you change a
-Right.
-utterance boundary segment, which is gonna happen a lot.
-And so I wanted something where all of this can be done in a elegant way and that if somebody
-wants to try something or compute something else, that it can be done flexibly.
-Um, it doesn't have to be pretty, it just has to be,
-you know, easy to use, and
