-Yeah. And so then it would just be a matter of getting
-making sure to handle the annotations that are, you know, not at the word-level and, um,
-Where are those annotations coming from?
-t to import the
-Well, right now, I g Jane would would
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.
-Are you talking about the overlap a annotations?
-Yeah, any kind of annotation that, like, isn't already there. Uh, you know, anything you can envision.
-Yeah.
-So what I was imagining was um, so Dave says we can have unlimited numbers of green ribbons.
-And so put, uh, a a green ribbon on for an overlap code.
-And since we w we I I think it's important to remain flexible regarding the time bins for now.
-And so it's nice to have
-However, you know, you want to have it, uh, time time uh, located in the discourse. So, um,
-if we if we tie the overlap code to the first word in the overlap,
-then you'll have a time-marking. It won't it'll be independent of the time bins,
-however these e evolve, shrink, or whatever, increase, or Also, you could have different time bins for different purposes.
-And having it tied to the first word in an overlap segment is unique, uh, you know, anchored, clear.
-And it would just end up on a separate ribbon.
-So the overlap coding is gonna be easy with respect to that.
-Right.
-You look puzzled.
-I I just I don't quite understand what these things are. Uh.
-OK. What, the codes themselves? Or the?
-Well, th overlap codes. I'm not sure what that
-Well, I mean, is that
-Well, we don't have to go into the codes. We don't have to go into the codes. But let me just
-It probably doesn't matter. No, I d
-I mean, it doesn't. I mean, that not for the topic of this meeting.
-No. W the idea is just to have a separate green ribbon,
-you know, and and and let's say that this is a time bin. There's a word here. This is the first word of an overlapping segment of any length,
-overlapping with any other, uh, word uh, i segment of any length. And, um,
-then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a ch a backchannel,
-or you can say that it was, um, a usurping of the turn, or you can you know, any any number of categories. But the fact is, you have it time-tagged
-in a way that's independent of the, uh, sp particular time bin that the word ends up in.
-If it's a large unit or a small unit, or we sh change the boundaries of the units,
-Mm-hmm.
-Right.
-it's still unique and and, uh, fits with the format,
-flexible, all that.
