-Um,
-it would be nice um,
-eh, gr this is sort of r regarding
-uh, uh it's related but not directly germane to the topic of discussion, but, when it comes to annotations, um,
-you often find yourself in the situation where you have different annotations of the same, say, word sequence.
-Yeah.
-OK? And sometimes the word sequences even differ slightly because they were edited s at one place but not the other.
-Yeah.
-So, once this data gets out there, some people might start annotating this for,
-I don't know, dialogue acts or, um,
-you know, topics or what the heck. You know, there's a zillion things that people might annotate this for.
-And the only thing that
-is really sort of common among all the versi the various versions of this data is the word sequence,
-Yep.
-or approximately.
-Or the time.
-Or the times. But, see, if you'd annotate dialogue acts, you don't necessarily want to or topics you don't really want to be dealing with time-marks.
-I guess.
-You'd it's much more efficient for them to just see the word sequence, right?
-Mm-hmm.
-I mean, most people aren't as sophisticated as as we are here with, you know, uh, time alignments and stuff. So
-So the the the point is
-Should should we mention some names on the people who are n?
-Right.
-So, um, the p my point is that you're gonna end up with,
-uh, word sequences that are differently annotated. And you want some tool,
-uh, that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single,
-uh, version.
-OK?
-Um, and we had this problem very massively, uh, at SRI when we worked, uh, a while back on,
-uh
-well, on dialogue acts as well as, uh, you know, um, what was it? uh,
-Well, all the Switchboard in it. Yeah.
-utterance types. There's, uh, automatic, uh, punctuation and stuff like that.
-Because we had one set of annotations that were based on,
-uh, one version of the transcripts with a particular segmentation, and then we had another version that was based on,
-uh, a different s slightly edited version of the transcripts with a different segmentation. So,
-we had these two different
-versions which were you know, you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical. So it was extremely hard
-to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations.
-Yep. I I don't see any way that file formats are gonna help us with that. It's it's all a question of semantic.
-No.
-No. But once you have a file format, I can imagine writing
-Mm-hmm.
-not personally, but someone writing a tool that is essentially an alignment tool,
-Yeah.
-um, that mediates between various versions, and
-uh, sort of like th uh, you know, you have this thing in UNIX where you have, uh,
-Diff.
-W-diff or diff. Yeah.
-diff.
-There's the, uh, diff that actually tries to reconcile different
-Is it S-diff?
-two diffs f based on the same original.
-Yep.
-Mmm.
-Something like that,
-um, but operating on these lattices that are really what's behind this uh, this annotation format.
-Yep.
-So
-You could definitely do that with the
-There's actually a diff library you can use to do things like that that
-So somewhere in the API you would like to have like a merge or some some function that merges two
-so you have different formats.
-Yeah, I think it's gonna be very hard. Any sort of structured
-two versions.
-Right.
-anything when you try to merge is really, really hard because you ha i
-The hard part isn't the file format. The hard part is specifying what you mean by "merge".
-Is
-Exactly.
-But the one thing that would work here actually for i that is more reliable than the utterances is the
-And that's very difficult.
-the speaker ons and offs. So if you have a good, um
-But this is exactly what I mean, is that that the problem i
-Yeah.
-You just have to know wha what to tie it to.
-Yeah, exactly. The problem is saying "what are the semantics, what do you mean by "merge"?" So.
-And
-Right, right.
-Right.
-So so just to let you know what we where we kluged it by, uh, doing
-uh, by doing Hhh.
-Both were based on words, so, bo we have two versions of the same words intersp you know, sprinkled with with different tags for annotations.
-And then you did diff. Yeah, that's just what I thought.
-And we did diff. Exactly!
-And that's how Yeah.
-That's just wh how I would have done it.
-But, you know, it had lots of errors and things would end up in the wrong order, and so forth. Uh, so,
-Yep.
-um, if you had a more
-Uh, it it was a kluge because it was basically reducing everything to uh, to uh, uh, to textual alignment.
-A textual
-Um, so
-But, d isn't that something where whoever if if the people
-who are making changes, say in the transcripts, cuz this all happened when the transcripts were different
-ye um, if they tie it to something, like if they tied it to the acoustic segment if they
-You know what I mean? Then Or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time-marks, that would help. But the problem is exactly as Adam said, that you get,
-Yep.
-you know, y you don't have that information or it's lost in the merge somehow, so
-Well, can I ask one question? It it seems to me that, um, we will have o an official version of the corpus, which will be only one
-one version in terms of the words where the words are concerned.
-We'd still have the the merging issue maybe if coding were done independently of the
-And you're gonna get that because if the data gets out, people will do all kinds of things to it.
-But but
-And, uh, s you know, several years from now you might want to look into, um,
-the prosody of
-referring expressions. And someone at the university of who knows where has annotated the referring expressions.
-Right.
-So you want to get that annotation and bring it back in line with your data.
-OK, then
-But unfortunately they've also hand-edited it.
-OK?
-But they've also Exactly. And so that's exactly what we should somehow when you distribute the data, say that you know,
-Yeah.
-Yep.
-Right.
-Well, then the
-that have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that.
-What's what's wrong with doing times? I
-I agree. That was what I was wondering.
-Uh, yeah, time is the Time is passing!
-Time is unique. You were saying that you didn't think we should Andreas was saying Yeah.
-Well,
-Time time times are
-what if they haven't notated with them, times?
-Yeah.
-ephemeral.
-He he's a language modeling person, though.
-Um
-So so imagine I think his his example is a good one. Imagine that this person who developed the corpus of the referring expressions didn't include time.
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.
-Ach!
-He included references to words. He said that at this word is when when it happened. Or she.
-Well, then
-Yeah.
-Or she.
-But then couldn't you just indirectly figure out the time tied to the word?
-But still they
-Exactly. Yeah.
-Sure. But what if what if they change the words?
-Not Well, but you'd have some anchoring point. He couldn't have changed all the words.
-But can they change the words without changing the time of the word?
-Sure. But they could have changed it a little.
-The the point is, that that they may have annotated it off a word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript, so how do you merge it back in? I understand what you're saying.
-Mmm. Mm-hmm.
-And I I guess the answer is,
-um, it's gonna be different every time.
-It's j it's just gonna be
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-You only know the boundaries of the
-I it's exactly what I said before, which is that "what do you mean by "merge"?"
-So in this case where you have the words and you don't have the times, well, what do you mean by "merge"?
-Right.
-If you tell me what you mean, I can write a program to do it.
-Right. You can merge at the level of the representation that the other person preserved and that's it.
-Right. And that's about all you can do.
-And beyond that, all you know is is relative ordering and sometimes even that is wrong.
-So so in so in this one you would have to do a best match between the word sequences,
-So.
-Mm-hmm.
-extract the times f from the best match of theirs to yours, and use that.
-And then infer that their time-marks are somewhere in between. Yeah, exactly.
-Right.
-But it could be that they just uh, I mean, it could be that they chunked they they lost certain utterances and all that stuff, or
-Right, exactly. So it could get very, very ugly.
-Definitely. Definitely.
-Yeah.
