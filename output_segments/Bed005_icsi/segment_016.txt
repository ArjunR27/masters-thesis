-and here is the more interesting stuff for us, is the routes,
-route elements,
-and, again, as we thought it's really simple. This is sort of the, uh,
-um, parameters. We have
-simple "from objects" and "to objects" and so forth,
-points of interest along the way
-And, um,
-I asked them whether or not we could, um
-First of all, I was little bit
-It seemed to me that this m way of doing it is sort of a stack a step backwards from the way we've done it before. t
-It seems to me that some notions were missing.
-So these are these are
-S
-So these are these are your friends back at EML.

-So this is not a complicated negotiation.
-There's there's not seven committees, or anything, right?
-No.

-It's a design thing, not a political thing.

-Exactly. And, um
-Good.
-And, uh
-However, the, uh
-e So that you understand, it is really simple. Uh You you have a route, and you cut it up in different pieces.
-And every
-every element of that e r r f of that
-Every segment we call a "route element".
-And so, from A to B we cut up in three different steps,
-and every step has a "from object" where you start, a "to object" where y where you sort of end, and some points of interest along the way.
-What w I was sort of missing here, and uh, maybe it was just me being too stupid, is, I didn't sort of get the the notion of the global goal
-of the whole route. Really, s was not straightforward visibly for me.
