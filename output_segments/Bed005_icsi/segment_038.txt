-Wha-still sort of leaves one question.
-It I mean you you can always uh see easily that that I'm not grasping everything correctly, but what seemed attractive to me in im uh in the last discussion we had, was
-that we find out a means of
-of getting these point four, point five, point one,
-of C-four,
-not because, you know, A is a Landmark or not, but we we we label this whatever object type,
-and if it's a garden,
-it's point three, point four, point two. If it's a castle, it's point eight, point one, point one. If it's, uh, a town hall, it's point two, point three, point five.
-Right.
-And so forth.
-And we don't want to write this down
-necessarily every time for something but, uh
-It'll be students Where else would it be stored? That's the question.
-let's see.
-Well, in the beginning, we'll write up a flat file. We know we have twenty object types and we'll write it down in a flat file.
-Oh.
-Yeah.
-No. So, i is
-Well, let me say something, guys, cuz there's not There's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now.
-Mm-hmm.
-Which is
-The hierarchy that s comes with the ontology
-is just what you want for this. So that
-Uh, if you know about it let's say, a particular town hall
-that, it's one that is a monument,
-then, that would be stored there.
-If you don't, you look up the hierarchy,
-Eh so, you you you may or So, then you'd have this little vector of,
-um, you know, Approach Mode or EVA Mode. Let's OK, so we have the EVA vector for for various kinds of landmarks. If you know it for a specific landmark you put it there.
-If you don't, you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one.
-OK.
-So, is the idea to put it in the ontology?
-Absolutely.
-OK.
-Uh, or, link to or but but in any case i View it logically as being in the ontology. It's part of what you know about
-a an object, is its EVA vector.
-OK. Mm-hmm.
-And, if yo As I say, if you know about a specific object, you put it there. This is part of what Dekai was doing.
-So, when we get to Wu,
-Right.
-The-e We'll see w what he says about that.
-And, then if you
-If it isn't there, it's higher, and if you don't know anything except that it's a b it's it's a building, then up at the highest thing, you have the pr what amounts to a prior.
-If you don't know anything else about a building,
-uh, you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at that level, which might be equal, or whatever it is.
-Right.
-Yeah.
-So, that's a very pretty relationship between
-these local vectors and the ontology.
-And it seems to me the obvious thing to do, unless
-we find a reason to do something different.
-Yeah.
-Does this make sense to you? Bhask-?
-So
-Yeah.
