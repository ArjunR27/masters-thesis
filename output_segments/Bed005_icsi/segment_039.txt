-So, we are but we we're not doing the ontology, so we have to get to whoever is doing the u ultimately,
-Indeed. So, that's another thing we're gonna need to do, is is, to,
-we have to get them to
-either
-We're gonna need some way to either get a p tag in the ontology, or add fields, or
-some way to associate Or, w It may be that all we can do is, um, some of our own hash tables that it
-Th-the th you know, there's always a way to do that. It's a just a question of
-i
-Yeah, hash on object name to, you know, uh, the probabilities or whatever.
-th
-Yeah.
-e
-Right. And, so,
-i
-uh
-But it's, uh Well, it strikes me as a What For-
-If we get the mechanism,
-that will be sort of the wonderful part. And then,
-how to make it work is is the second part, in the sense that
-I mean, m the guy who was doing the ontology
-eh, eh, s ap apologized that i it will take him another through
-two to three days because they're having really trouble getting the upper level
-straight, and
-right now. The reason is,
-given the craw bet uh, the the the projects
-that all carry their own taxonomy and, on all history,
-they're really trying to build one top level ontology ft that covers all the EML projects, and that's, uh, uh, sort of a tough cookie, a little bit tougher than they
-figured. I could have told them s so. Uh.
-Right. Yeah.
-But, nevertheless, it's going to be there by n by, uh, next Monday and I will show you what's what some examples from that for towers, and stuff.
-And, um,
-what I don't think is ever going to be in the ontology, is sort of, you know, the likelihood of, eh, people entering r
-town halls, and looking at town halls, and approaching town halls,
-especially since we are b dealing with a case-based, not an instance-based ontology.
-So, there will be nothing on on that town hall, or on the Berkeley town hall, or on the
-Heidelberg town hall, it'll just be information on town halls.
-But what
-Well, they they they How ar What are they gonna do with instances? I mean, you y
-Well, that's Hhh.
-That's that's al different question. I mean, th the first, they had to make a design question,
-"do we take ontologies that have instances? or just one that does not, that just has the types?"
-OK.
-And, so, since the d decision was on types, on a d simply type-based,
-we now have to hook it up to instances.
-I mean this is
-one
-But what i What is SmartKom gonna do about that?
-Cuz, they have instances all the time.
-Yeah, but the ontology is really not a SmartKom
-thing,
-in in and of itself. That's more something that
-I kicked loose
-in in EML. So it's a completely EML
-thing.
-But
-Uh uh SmartKom's gonna need an ontology.
-Yes, u a w a lot of people are aware of that.
-I understand, but is anybody doing anything about it?
-Um
-OK. It's a political problem. We won't worry about it.
-No, but th the r eh I th I still think that
-there is enough information in there.
-For example, whether OK. So, th it will know about the twenty object types there are in the world.
-Let's assume there are only twenty object types in this world.
-And it will know if any of those have institutional meanings.
-So, in a sense, "I" used as Institutions for some s in some sense or the other.
-Which makes them
-enterable.
-Right? In a sense. You know.
