-Yeah.
-Anyway. So we may have to This is with the whole thing, we may have to build another data stru
-Yep.
-Yep.
-Conceptually, we know what should be done.
-When we see what people have done, it may turn out that the easiest thing to do
-is to build a a separate thing that that
-just pools i i
-Like, i i it it may be,
-that,
-the the instance w That we have to build our own
-instance, uh,
-Yeah, it's Right, we can just assume
-things, that,
-with their types, and then it goes off to the ontology once you have its type. So we build a little data structure And so what we would do in that case,
-is, in our instance gadget have
-our E V As.
-And if we d there isn't one we'd get the type and then have the E V As for the type. So we'd have our own little,
-uh, EVA tree.
-Yeah. Right.
-And then, for other,
-uh, vectors that we need. So, we'd have our own little things so that whenever we needed one, we'd just use the ontology to get the type,
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.
-and then would hash or whatever we do to say, "ah! If it's that type of thing,
-and we want its EVA vector, pppt-pppt!
-it's that."
