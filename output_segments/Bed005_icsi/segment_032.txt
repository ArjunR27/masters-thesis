-Noisy-ORs are a way to, uh,
-sort of deal with this.
-Um
-Where should I put this?
-So, the idea is that, um,
-Let's call these, uh, C-one, C-two, C-three, and C-four, and E, for Cause and Effect, I guess.
-The idea is to have these intermediate nodes.
-Right.
-Well, actually, the idea, first of all, is that each of these things has a quote-unquote distinguished state, which means that this is
-the state in which we don't really know anything about it. So right?
-So, for example, if we don't really know if the thing is a landmark or not,
-Or, i if that just doesn't seem relevant, then that would be th sort of the Disting-the Distinguish state. It's a really, you know,
-if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee,
-you know, if they didn't talk about it, that would be the Distinguish state.
-S so, this is a fanciful way of saying "default"?
-So
-Yeah, yeah. That's just what they the word they used in that paper.
-OK.
-Mm-hmm.
-So, the idea is that, um, you have these intermediate nodes, right? E-one, E-two, E-three and E-four?
-So, this is the Heckerman paper you're working with? Good.
-Yeah.
-So
-The idea is that, each of these EI
-is
-represents what this would be
-if all the other ones were in the distinguish state. Right?
-So, for example, suppose that the person I mean, suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark.
-But none of the other sort of cues really apply.
-Then, this would be
-W The this would just represent the probability distribution of this,
-assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply?
-So, you know, if it is a landmark, and no none of the other things really ap applicable, then this would represent the probability distribution. So maybe in this case
-Maybe we just t k Maybe we decide that, if the thing's a landmark and we don't know anything else, then we're gonna conclude that, um
-They want to view it with probability, you know, point four. They want to enter it with probability, uh
-with probability point five and they want to approach it probability point one, say
-Right? So we come up with these l little tables for each of those
-OK.
-And the final thing is that, um
-this is a deterministic function of these,
-so we don't need to specify any probabilities.
-We just have to, um, say what function this is, right?
-So we can let this be, um
-G of E-one comma E-two.
-E-three, E-four.
-Right?
-and our example G would be, um,
-a majority vote?
-Right?
-Well. OK, so th so the important point
-is
-W not what the G function is.
-The important point is
-that
-Um
-There is a a a general kind of idea of shortcutting the full CPT. Th-c the full conditional probability table with some function.
-OK? Which y w you choose appropriately for each case. So, depending on what your situation is, there are different functions which are most appropriate.
-And
-So I gave eh Bhaskara a copy of this, eh sort of "ninety-two" paper. D and you got one, Robert. I don't know who else has seen it.
-Mm-hmm.
-There's I mean yeah. it's Heckerman and Breese.
-It's short.
-It's short.
-Yeah.
-So, I u w Um, yo uh you Have you read it yet?
-Uh, you can Yeah, you should take a look at it, I guess.
-OK, so you should take a look. Nancy, I'm sure you read it at some point in life.
-OK
-I yeah. I I think so, yeah.
-OK.
-Yeah,.
-And so, you other guys can decide how interested Anyway. So the paper isn't th isn't real hard. And
