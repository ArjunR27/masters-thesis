-I mean if if you want to
-uh, push us into reference problems, that would be great.
-OK.
-OK, so this is his specialty is reference,
-Mm-hmm.
-and you know, what what are these things referring to? Not only
-anaphora, but, uh, more generally the,
-uh
-this whole issue of,
-uh, referring expressions, and, what is it that they're actually
-dealing with in the world?
-Mm-hmm.
-And, again, this is li in the databa this is also pretty well formed because there is an ontology,
-and the database, and stuff. So it isn't like,
-um, you know, the Evening Star or stuff like that. I i it
-Right.
-All the entities
-do have concrete reference. Although th the To get at them from a language may not be trivial.
-Right.
-Right.
-There aren't
-really deep mysteries about
-um, what w what things the system knows about.
-Right. And you have both proper names and descriptions and y and you can ask for it.
-All those things. Yeah. You have proper names, and descriptions.
-Mm-hmm.
-Right. OK.
-And a l and a lot and and anaphora, and pronouns, and
-Nuh.
-Right.
-Right.
-all those things.
-Now, we hav the the whole Unfortunately, the whole database is, uh, in German.
-We have just commissioned someone to translate some bits of it, IE the e
-the shortest k the the more general descriptions of all the objects and, um, persons and events. So, it's a relational database with persons, events,
-and, um, objects.
-And it's it's quite, um,
-there. But did y I uh I think there will be great because the reference problem really is not trivial, even if you have such a g
-well-defined world.
-He knows.
-Ah-he you are not, uh, throwing uh, uh, carrying owls to Athens.
-Could you give me an example of a reference problem? so so l I can make it more concrete?
-Well
-How do I get to the Powder-Tower?
-We sort of t think that our bit in this problem is interesting, but, just to get from Powder-Tower to an object I ID in a database
-is also not really trivial.
-Or or if you take something even more scary, um, "how do I get to the third building after the Tower? the Ple-Powder-Tower?" Uh, you need some mechanism for
-Mmm.
-Yeah.
-Or, you know, the church across from City Hall, or
-Or the re the restaurant where they wear lederhosen? Or is that
-Or the
-Right.
-Yeah, that would be fine.
-Uniquely.
-Right.
-OK.
-Yeah.
-O or or tower, or this tower, or that building, or
-Right.
-hmm?
-OK.
-Or you can say "how" you know, "how do I get back?"
-Trying to
-Yeah, yeah.
-OK.
