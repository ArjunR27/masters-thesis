-But, anyway, s skipping skipping the question of exactly which functions
-now is it clear
-that you might like to be able to
-shortcut
-the whole conditional probability table.
-I mean, in some it seems very plausible in some sense, where we will be likely to not be observe some of the stuff.
-Cuz we don't have the a access to the information.
-Oops, sorry.
-Right. That's one of the problems, is, W Is is, Where would th Where would it all come from?
-Yeah.
-So.
-Is Oh, right. W would not be ab able to observe
-Mmm.
-What?
-I if it's a a a discar Discourse Initial Phrase, we will have nothing in the discourse history.
-So, if if we ever want to wonder what was mention
-Oh
-Oh. A are you saying that we'll not be able to observe certain nodes? That's fine. That is sort of orthogonal thing.
-Yeah, so there's there's two separate things, Robert.
-The f the the the Bayes-nets in general are quite good
-at saying, "if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that."
-OK? Th-that's what they're real good at.
-So, if you don't have any information about the discourse,
-you just use your priors of of whatever
-eh the discourse
-uh,
-eh, basically whatever w it's Probabilistically, whatever it would be. And it's it's sort of not a great estimate, but
-Mm-hmm.
-it's the best one you have,
-and, so forth. So that, they're good at. But the other problem is, how do you fill in all these numbers?
-And I think that's the one he was getting at.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Yeah. So, specifically in this case you have to f
-have this many numbers, whereas in this case you just have to have three for this, three for this, three for this. Right? So you have to have just
-Mm-hmm.
-three N?
-So, this is much smaller than that.
-Asymptotically.
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah. Right.
-Well, pretty quickly.
-U yeah, yeah.
-I mean
-So, you don't need da data enough to cover uh, nearly as much stuff.
-I don't know.
