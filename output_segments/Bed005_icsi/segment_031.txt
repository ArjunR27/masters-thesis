-Yeah. So, um Recall that, uh,
-we want to have
-this kind of structure in our Bayes-nets.
-Namely, that, um You have these nodes that have several bands, right? So
-Does I mean, they sort of
-the typical example is that, um, these are all a bunch of cues for something, and this is a certain effect that we'd like to conclude.
-So, uh
-Like, let's just look at the case when, um, this is actually the the final action, right? So this is like, uh,
-you know,
-Y
-touch, or Sorry. Uh
-E-EVA
-Yeah, E-EVA, right?
-Yeah.
-Enter, V View, Approach, right?
-W what was this? It i i i ehhh, i ehhh.
-So, this is
-Wri-write it out for for
-Yeah. Enter,
-I mean
-View,
-Approach.
-OK. Right.
-Right.
-So, I mean, we'd like to take all these various cues, right? So this one might be, say, uh
-Like the army. Yeah.
-New terminology? I haven't heard that before.
-Well, let me pick a random one and say, uh
-Hmm?
-I don't know, it could be, like
-This isn't the way it really is, but let me say that, suppose someone mentioned, uh,
-admission fees
-Ah, it takes too long. Try let me just say "Landmark".
-If the thing is a landmark,
-you know, um then there's another thing that says if
-um
-if it's closed or not, at the moment.
-Alright, so you have nodes. Right? And the, uh, problem that we were having was that, you know, given N-nodes, there's "two to the N"
-Given N-nodes, and furthermore, the fact that there's three things here, we need to specify "three times", uh, "two to the N" probabilities.
-Right? That's assuming these are all binary, which f they may not be. For example, they could be "time of day", in which case we could, uh, say, you know, "Morning,
-afternoon, evening, night". So, this could be more
-So, it's a lot, anyway.
-And, that's a lot of probabilities to put here, which is kind of a pain. So
