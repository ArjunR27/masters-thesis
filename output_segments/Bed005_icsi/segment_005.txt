-So.
-But I I will just make a first draft of the, uh, note, the "write-up" note, send it to you and Fey and then

-Well, yeah. There's one tricky part
-about,
-um, they have the right

-"on the same form, we need a separate form." But anyway. I'd I'd I'd like to,
-e e um, add an a little thi eh a thing for them to initial, saying "nah, do I don't want to see the final transcript." But other than that, that's one's been approved,
-Mm-hmm.
-this really is the same project,
-uh, rec you know. And so forth. So I think we just go with it.
