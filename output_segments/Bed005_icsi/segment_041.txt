-So, I I think we can handle that. And then But, the combination functions,
-and whether we can put those in Java Bayes, and all that sort of stuff,
-is, uh is the bigger deal.
-Yeah.
-I think that's where we have to get technically clever.
-Um
-We could just steal the classes in JavaBayes and then
-interface to them with our own code.
-Well, I me ye eh, yeah, the
-That requires understanding the classes in JavaBayes, I guess.
-Yeah, I mean, it's, uh, e e e e e cute.
-I mean, you've been around enough to
-I mean
-Just?
-Well, it depends on
-I mean, there's this huge package which which may or may not be consistent and you know.
-But, yeah, we could look at it.
-Well, I was j OK. Yeah.
-Yeah.
-It's b It
-It's an inter sort of a kind of a it The thing is, it's kind of an interpreter and i i it expects its data structures to
-be in a given form, and if you say, "hey, we're gonna
-make a different kind of data structure to stick in there"
-Well, no, but that just means there's a protocol,
-right? That you could
-It may or may not. I don't know. That's the question is "to what extent does it allow us to put in these G functions?"
-And I don't know.
-Well, no, but I mean What I uh the
-So you could have four different Bayes-nets that you're running, and then run your own write your own function that would take the output of those four,
-and make your own "G function", is what I was saying.
-Yeah, that's fine if it's if it comes only at the end. But suppose you want it embedded?
-Well, then you'd have to break all of your Bayes-nets into smaller Bayes-nets, with all the
-Oh, that Yeah, that's a truly horrible way to do d it. One would hope
-Yeah, but I'm just
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you bet.
-But, at that point you may say, "hey, Java Bayes isn't the only package in town. Let's see if there's
-another package that's, eh, more civilized about this."
-.
-Now, Srini
-Mmm.
-is worth talking to on this,
-cuz he
-said that he actually did
-hack some combining functions into JavaBayes.
-Ah!
-But he doesn't remember at least when I talked to him, he didn't remember
-whether it was an e an easy thing, a natural thing, or whether he had to do some violence to it to make it work.
-Uh. But he did do it.
-Yeah.
-I don't see why the, uh, combining f functions have to be directly hacked into JavaBayes. I mean, they're used to create tables so we can just make our own little functions that create tables in XML.
-Well, I say that's one way to do it, is is to just convert it
-int into a into a C P T that you zip
-It's blown up, and is a it's, uh it's huge, but
-it doesn't require any
-Mm-hmm.
-data fitting or complication.
-Yeah.
-I don't think I mean, the fact that it blown u blows up is a huge issue in the sense that
-I mean, OK. So say it blows up, right? So there's, like,
-the
-you know, ten, f ten, fifteen, uh, things. It's gonna be like, two to the
-that, which isn't so bad.
-I I understand. I'm just saying tha that w
-That was wi that was my note.
-The little note I sent said that.
-Mm-hmm.
-It said, "Here's the way you'd take
-the logical f G function and turn it into a CPT."
-Mm-hmm.
-I mean that the Max-the Evidence-Combining function.
-So we could do that. And maybe that's what we'll do.
-But, um
-don't know.
