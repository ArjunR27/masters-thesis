-Alright. Anyway. So, uh, before we get started with the, uh, technical part, I just want to review what I think is happening with the
-We are all switched on.
-our data collection. So
-Uh, probably after today,
-that shouldn't come up in this meeting. Th-this this is s should be im it isn't There's another thing going on of gathering data,
-and that's pretty much independent of this.
-But, uh, I just want to make sure we're all together on this.
-What we think is gonna happen is that,
-uh, in parallel starting about now we're gonna get Fey
-to,
-where you're working with me and Robert, draft a note that we're gonna send out to various CogSci c and other classes saying, "here's an opportunity to be a subject.
-Contact Fey."
-And then there'll be a certain number of um, hours during the week which she will be available and we'll bring in
-people. Uh, roughly how many, Robert?
-We d Do we know?
-Um, fifty was our sort of our first
-OK. So, we're looking for a total of fifty people, not necessarily by any means all students but we'll s we'll start with with that.
-In parallel with that, we're gonna need to actually do the script.
-And, so, I guess there's a plan to have a meeting Friday afternoon
-Uh, with uh, Jane, and maybe Liz and whoever, on actually getting the script worked out.
-But what I'd like to do, if it's O K,
-is to s
-to, as I say, start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week.
-The week after that's Spring Break, and maybe we'll look for them some subjects next door or i
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Also, Fey will not be here during spring break. So.
-Oh, OK, then we won't do it. OK. So that's easy.
-Um.
-So, is Is that
-make sense to everybody?
-Yeah. Also, um, F both Fey and I will, um,
-do something of which I may, eh
-kindly ask you to to do the same thing, which is we gonna check out our social infrastructures for possible subjects. Meaning,
-um, kid children's gymnastic classes, pre-school parents and so forth.
-They also sometimes have flexible schedules.
-So, if you happen to be sort of in a non-student social setting, and you know people who may be interested in being subjects
-We also considered using the Berkeley High School and their teachers, maybe,
-and get them interested in
-That's a good idea.
-stuff.
-And, um.
-So that's as far as our brainstorming was concerned.
-Oh, yeah. The high school's a great idea.
