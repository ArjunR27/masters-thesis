-So, you can sho You you Are are you gonna show us the little templates?
-S
-Yeah. We ar we can sh er I can show you the templates.
-"The former end g" Oh, I see. Uh-huh.
-I I also have it running here, so if I
-do this now,
-um, you can see that
-it parsed the wonderful English sentence, "Which films are on the cinema today evening?"
-Well, that sounds
-But, um.
-Uh do don't worry about it. It could be
-No i
-"this evening, which which films are on the cinema", or "running in the cinema, which"
-OK.
-uh, "today evening", uh i
-"Is anything happening in the cinema this evening?"
-OK. Key words, e basically.
-Well
-Ge-elaborate, or, more or less, uh
-Actually, it's a little tricky,
-in that there's some
-allowable German orders which aren't allowable English orders and so forth. And it is order-based. So it it
-Isn't it?
-No.
-No.
-Oh. So it it doe I it These
-It is not
-u these optional elements, it's it's actually a set, not a sequence?
-Yeah. We were I was afraid that, um
-Oh!
-So it really is key word matching, basically.
-Really a se
-Um.
-e yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Oh, wow.
-Um, I mean, these sentences are just silly. I mean, uh, d these were not the ones we we actually did it.
-Hmm.
-Um. What's an idiomatic of phrasing this? Which films are
-Are pl playing at the cinema?
-showing? playing?
-Yeah.
-Tonight?
-I changed that file, actually, where it's on my account.
-Actually, you would say, "which films are on tonight?"
-This this evening?
-You want to get it? Or is di was it easy to get it?
-Um. I have no net here.
-Oh, OK.
-Do I?
-OK. So. Wonderful parse, same thing.
-Um.
-Right.
-Except that we d w we don't have this, uh, time information here now, which is,
-um
-Oh. This are the reserve.
-Anyways.
-So.
-Um.
-These are the sort of the ten different sentence types
-that the uh
-the parser was able to do. And it still is, now in English.
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.
-And, um Sorry.
-And, um
-you have already to make it a little bit more elaborate, right?
-Yeah, I mean I changed those sentences to make it, uh,
-more, uh, idiomatic.
-And, of course, you can have i
-many variations in those sentences, they will still parse fine.
-So, in a sense it's pretty broad.
-OK.
-OK.
-So, if you want to look at the templates,
-they're conveniently located in a file, "template".
-Um,
-and this is what I had to do. I had to change,
-"Spielfilm" to "film", uh, "Film" to "movie", cinem "Kino" to "cinema"
-to "today" heu "heute" to "today", evening "Abend" to "evening"
-Huh.
-Capitalized as well
-Hmm.
-And, um.
-Y i
-One thing I was wondering, was,
-those functions there, are those things that modify the M-three-L basically?
-Yep.
-OK.
-And that's that's the next step, but we'll get to that in a second.
-p
-And so this means, um,
-Oh.
-"this" and "see" are not optional.
-"Want I like" is all maybe in there, but may also not be in there.
-So so, the point is, if it says "this" and "see", it also will work in "see" and "this"?
-S
-In the other order?
-Yeah.
-with those two key words?
-Should we try it?
-"This is the one I want to see"
-or whatever.
-OK.
-"Action watch",
-Hmm.
-whatever. Nothing was specialfi specified.
-except that it has some references to audio-visual media here.
-AV medium.
-Yeah.
-Where it gets that from It's correct, but I don't know where it gets it from.
-"See".
-Oh, "see". Yeah.
-I mean it's sort of
-Yeah. Yep. OK.
-And "see this"
-is exactly the same thing.
-OK, so it is set-based. Alright.
