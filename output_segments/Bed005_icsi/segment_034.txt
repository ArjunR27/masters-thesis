-One of the questions just come at Bhaskara is,
-"How much of this does JavaBayes support?"
-Yeah, it's a good question. Um
-The so what we want, is basically JavaBayes to support deterministic, uh, functions.
-Right.
-And, um In a sense it sup we can make it supported by, um, manually, uh, entering, you know, probabilities that are one and zeros, right?
-Right. So the little handout that The little thing that I sent I sent a message saying,
-uh, here is a way to take
-One thing you could do, which is kind of s in a way, stupid, is take this deterministic function,
-and use it to build the CPT.
-So, if Ba-JavaBayes won't do it for you,
-Mmm.
-that you can convert all that into what the CPT would be.
-Um and, what I sent out about a week ago, was an idea of how to do that,
-for,
-um, evidence combination. So one of one function that you could use as your "G function" is an e e Evidence-Combining. So you just take the
-uh, if each of th if each of the ones has its own
-little table like that, then you could take the,
-uh, strength of each of those, times its little table, and you'd add up the total evidence for "V", "E", and "A".
-Mmm.
-I don't think you can do this, because
-Mm-hmm.
-Yep.
-G is a function from
-that
-to that.
-Right.
-Right? So there's no numbers. There's just
-quadruplets of well, N-duplets of, uh, E Vs.
-I i i
-No, no But I'm saying is There
-There is a w I mean, if y if if you decide what's what is appropriate, is probablistic evidence combination, you can write a function
-that does it. It's a pui it's actually one of the examples he's got in there.
