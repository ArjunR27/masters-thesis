-So, well, let Now, this is important. Let, uh I want a a Again, outside of m almost managerial point,
-um
-You're in the midst of this, so you know better. But it seems to me it's probably
-a good idea to
-li uh minimize the number of
-uh, change requests we make of them.
-So it seemed to me, what we ought to do is get our story together.
-OK? And think about it some, internally, before
-asking them to make changes.
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh. Does this does this make sense to you guys? It I mean you're you're doing the the interaction but it seemed to me that
-what we ought to do is come up with a
-uh, something where you, um
-And I I don't know who's mok working most closely on it. Probably Johno.
-OK.
-Uh, take what they have,
-send it to everybody saying "this is what they have, this is what we think we should add",
-OK? and then have a d a an iteration within our group saying "Hmm, well"
-OK? And get our best idea of what we should add.
-Mm-hmm.
-And then go back to them.
-Is i or, I don't know does this make sense to you? Or
-Yeah. Especially if we want
-Sort of, what I my feeling was eh we we sort of reserved something that has a r eh
-an OK label. That's th that was my th first sort of step.
-Mm-hmm.
-I w
-No matter how we want to call it,
-this is sort of our playground. And if we get something in there that is a structure elaborate and and and and and complex enough to to to maybe enable a whole simulation,
-Right.
-Right.
-one of these days,
-that would be u the the perfect goal.
-That's right. So. So, Yeah. The problem isn't the short ra range optimization.
-It's the sort of o one or two year kind of thing. OK. What are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two?
-How how would we try to characterize those and what do we want to request now
-that's leave enough space to do all that stuff?
-Mm-hmm. Yep.
-Right. And that re that requires some thought.
-Yep.
-And so that sounds like a great thing to do
-as the priority item
-um, as soon as we can do it.
-Yep.
-So y so you guys will send to the rest of us
-um
-a version of
-um, this,
-and the uh, description
-With sugge yeah, suggested improvements and
-Well b Yeah. So, the the uh Not everyone
-uh, reads German, so if you'd
-um
-Mmm.
-tu uh, tur change the description to, uh,
-English
-OK.
-and, um,
-Then then, yeah. Then, with some sug s suggestions about where where do we go from here?
-Uh, this and this, of course, was just the
-OK.
-action end. Uh, at some point we're going to have to worry about the language end. But for the moment just
-uh, t for this class of of things, we might want to try to encompass.
-And
-Then the scope of this is beyond
-Approach and Vis-or Vista. Yeah, yeah.
-Oh, yeah, yeah yeah yeah. This is this is everything that that,
-um,
-you know, um
-Yeah, yeah.
-we might want to do in the next couple years.
-So what would OK.
-Hmm?
-We don't I mean, that's an issue. We don't know what, entirely.
