-So whatever n this does I mean this is, basically, looks l to me like a function call, right?
-Hmm? Oh, yeah.
-And, um
-So, whenever it it encounters "Goodbye",
-which we can make it do in a second, here
-That function automatically generates an initialized
-XML structure?
-I
-I think each of those functions act on the current XML structure, and
-change it in some way, for example, by adding a
-y
-a l a field to it, or something.
-Yeah. They also seem to affect state, cause some of them
-Mm-hmm.
-there were other actions
-Right.
-uh, that that s seemed to step state variables somewhere, like the n s "Discourse Status Confirm".
-Yep.
-OK. So that's going to be a call on the discourse and confirm that it's
-W we Mm-hmm
-Oh, you mean that's not going to actually modify the tree, but it's going to change the event. Oh. Oh.
-I think that's right. I think it's actually That looks like it's state modification.
-e
-e mmm
-Um, well i
-There is a feature called "Discourse-Status",
-When there's a feature.
-Yeah.
-And so whenever I just say, "Write",
-it will it will put this in here.
-Oh, so it always just Is it So it
-Well, go back, then, cuz it may be that all those th things,
-h
-while they look like function calls, are just
-a way of adding exactly that to the XML.
-Yep.
-Uh-huh!
-So, this
-I'm not I'm not sure.
-e I'm not sure e that
-Um well, we we'll see, when we say,
-let's test something,
-"Goodbye",
-causes it to c to create basically an "Action Goodbye-End-Action". Which is a means of telling the system to shut down.
-Right.
-Right.
-Now, if we know that "Write"
-produces a "Feature Discourse-Status Confirm Discourse-Status".
-So if I now say "Write,
-Goodbye,"
-it should do that.
-It sho it creates this,
-Mm-hmm.
-"Confirm Goodbye".
-Right.
-Right there.
-Yep.
-But there is some kind of function call, because how does it know to put Goodbye in Content, but, uh, Confirm in Features?
-So-
-Oh. It d it n That's because
-So, it's not just that it's adding that field. It's
-Right.
-Absolutely. Good point.
-OK.
-It's it's the It's under what sub-type you're doing it. Yeah.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-It's mystery functions.
-Well, they're defined somewhere, presumably.
-Well, sometimes it m Sometimes, i
-Yeah, each is S so that's funny. You bury the s the state in the function
-When it
-Alright. Uh
-it
-Well, it just automatically initializes things that are common, right? So it's just a shorthand.
-Yeah.
-For example Oh, this is German. Sorry.
-e
-So, now, this, it cannot do anymore. Nothing comes out of here.
-A "not a number" is a value. Awesome.
-So, it
-doesn't speak German anymore, but it does speak English. And there is, here,
-a reference
-So, this tells us that whatever is has the ID "zero" is referenced here
-by the restriction seed and this is exa "I want"
-What was the sentence?
-"I want two seats here."
-"need two seats here." Nuh.
-"And where is it playing?" There should also be a reference to something, maybe.
-Our d This is re um
-Mmm.
-Here, we change and so, we Here we add something to the Discourse-Status, that the user wants to change something that was sort of done before
-And, uh
-and that, whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema.
-So then, whatever takes this M-three-L is what actually changes the state, not the
-Yeah, OK.
-No, right, the Discourse Maintainer, yeah.
-Yeah.
-I see. And it and it runs around looking for Discourse Status
-tags,
-and doing whatever it does with them.
-And other people ignore those tags.
