-uh, I think I'm gonna try to do,
-and I guess, pwww!
-let's say that by the end of spring break,
-I'll try to come up with some
-general story about,
-um, construction grammar, and what constructions we'd use and how all this might
-fit together. There's this whole framework problem that I'm feeling really uncomfortable about.
-And I haven't had a chance to
-think about it seriously. But I I want to
-I want to do that early, rather than late.
-And you and I will probably have to talk about this some.
-u u u u
-That's what strikes me, that we sort of
-the de g uh, small
-Something, uh, maybe we should address one of these days, is to That most of the work people actually always do is look at some statements,
-and and analyze those. Whether it's abstracts or newspapers and stuff like this.
-Hmm.
-But the whole i is it is it really relevant that we are dealing mostly with, sort of, questions?
-Oh, yeah? Well, I mean yeah, I d
-Uh, you know
-And this is It seems to me that we should maybe at least spend a session or or brainstorm a little bit about whether that l
-this is special case in that sense.
-Mm-hmm.
-Um,
-I don't know.
-You know Did we ever find m metaphorical use in in questions in in that sense, really?
-Yeah.
-You will.
-And how soon, I don't know.
-Oh, yeah.
-I mean, uh, we could take
-all the standard metaphor examples and make question
-versions of them.
-OK.
-Muh-
-"Who got kicked out of France?" Nuh.
-Yeah, or, you know. "Wh-why is he why is he pushing for promotion?" or, "who's pushing proof" er, just pick pick any of them and just
-Right.
-Nuh.
-Mm-hmm.
-do the eh
-So I don't I don't think,
-uh, it's at all
-difficult
-Uh, to convert them to question forms that really exist and people say all the time,
-um
-And sort of we don't know how to handle them, too. Right? I mean, it's
-I d
-It
-We don't know how to handle the declarative forms,
-really,
-and, then, the interrogative forms, ah-oh.
-Uh.
-Ooo!
-Yeah. Nancy, it looked like you were s
-Oh. it's just that that the goals
-are g very different to cases So we had this problem last year when we first thought about this domain, actually, was that
-most of the things we talked about are our story understanding. Uh, we're gonna have a short discourse and the person talking is trying to,
-Right.
-I don't know, give you a statement and tell you something. And here, it's th
-Help you create a mental model, blah-blah-blah. Yeah.
-Yea-eh y Yeah, I guess so. And then here, y you are j uh, the person is getting information and they or may not be following some larger plan,
-Yes.
-you know, that we have to recognize or, you know, infer.
-And th th the their discourse patterns probably
-don't follo follow quite as many
-logical connec Yeah.
-Right. No, I think that's one of things that's interesting, is is in this sort of
-over-arching story we we worked it out for th as you say, this the storytelling scenario.
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.
-And I think it's really worth thinking through
-what it looks like. What is the simspec mean, et cetera.
-Mm-hmm. M
-Right. Cuz for a while we were thinking, "well, how can we change the, um, data to sort of illicit tha illicit, um, actions that are more like what we are used to?"
-But obviously we would rather, you know, try to figure out what's what's, you know
