-One thing I was wondering was,
-those percentage signs, right?
-So, I mean,
-why do we even have them? Because if you didn't have them
-Yep.
-Uh, I'll tell you why. Because it gives a you a score.
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh.
-And the value of the score is, v I assume,
-I guess, the more of these optional things that are actually in there, the higher the r score
-OK.
-Right.
-It's a match.
-So that's the main purpose. Alright.
-it is.
-Mm-hmm.
-OK.
-So we we shouldn't belittle it too much. It's doing something,
-some things,
-and it's very flexible.

-the mapping of of, uh, words to the M-three-L but we also wanted to change add a new sentence type and and make up some some new M-three-L s"
-Yep.
-So-
-That'd be great. It would be a good exercise to just see
-See th
-whether one can get that to run.
-Mm-hmm.
-Yep.
-And, um,
-So, that's Fine, yeah.
-that's shouldn't be too tough.
